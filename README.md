#Fashon-website
Side project to include more javascript in my projects.

The first version was unnecessarily long(javascript). The second version cuts down a LOT of code.

#Version 1 

  Had too much code 
  Used if/else statments for different colours

#Version 2 
  Uses objects to clean up code. 
  One line of code to change all colours
